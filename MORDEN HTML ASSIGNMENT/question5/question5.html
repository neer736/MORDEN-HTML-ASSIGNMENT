                    Features of HTML5
                </h1>
                <p>
                   <b> 1.Audio and Video support </b> : HTML5 allows to embed Video and Audio directly with the help of "video"
                    and "Audio" tags. but in the previous versions of HTML is could be embeded by plugins pr 3rd party
                    application, which was not so easy but now in HTML5 its easy to embed with audio and video tags.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <b> 2.Semantic Tags/Elements </b>>: HTML5 introduced some Structural or Semantic tags to give better
                    Structure to the webpage. some Semantic tags are:
                    "header", "nav", "footer"
                    "section" , "article"  etc.

                <p>
                   <b> 3.SVG support </b>: SVG stands for (Scalable Vector Graphics) in past html versions we commonly use .png
                    and .jpg images but with them there is Scalablity issue so HTML5 introduced SVG graphical formate in
                    SVG we can scale height and width SVG's are Mathemetical figure so we can easily strech and shrink
                    image without loosing quality because it uses Mathemetical figures.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>4.Geolocation API </b>: Geolocation API gives the feature to access the user's Geolocation throw the browser by enabling browser request.</p>
